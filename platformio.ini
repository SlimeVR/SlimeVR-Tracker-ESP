; There are 2 main Boardtypes:
; 1. Boards that use a USB 2 Serial Chipset ( esp32-c3-devkitm-1, ttgo-t-oi-plus )
; 2. Boards that relay on the USB interface of the ESP32C3 ( lolin_c3_mini , dfrobot_beetle_esp32c3)
;    On this board there are 2 type some of them need to have set the build flag (menuconfig)
;    -DARDUINO_USB_MODE=1
;    -DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1
